## FraudScan
The aim of this Python project is to build a Machine learning classifier that can detect fraudulent transactions. 
Created in order to practice Random Forest and Logistic regression algorithm to discern fraudulent from non-fraudulent credit cards.
Inspiration for project found in [Data Science Project â€“ Detect Credit Card Fraud with Machine Learning in R](https://data-flair.training/blogs/data-science-machine-learning-project-credit-card-fraud-detection/)
